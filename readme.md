# OpenBMC Style Guide Proposal

This repository will be archived at the end of June 2020. The style guide for OpenBMC is being implemented as part of an application rewrite from AngularJS to Vue. With this rewrite, we are including the documenation as part the repository. The framework used to generate the static site is Vuepress. The documentation can be found in the docs direction in the [openbmc/webui-vue respository(https://www.github.com/openbmc/webui-vue)
